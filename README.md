# Sales Summary Single-Page Application

This is a client-side web application that fetches sales data from a CSV string embedded within the code, calculates the total sales amount, and displays it within a styled Bootstrap 5 interface.

## Features

- Loads Bootstrap 5.3.3 from CDN for an elegant, responsive design.
- Provides fallback CSS styling if Bootstrap fails to load.
- Parses CSV data directly from the script.
- Calculates and displays the sum of sales.

## Implementation Details

- The page's title includes a specific seed string for verification.
- Ensures Bootstrap CSS is loaded properly.
- The total sales are calculated by multiplying product prices by sales quantities.
- Validates the correctness of computations and setup.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. The total sales amount will be displayed within the styled card.

## Notes

- All logic is encapsulated within a `<script>` tag in the HTML file.
- No external CSV file is fetched; data is embedded for simplicity.
